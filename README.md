# Personal-Portfolio
A website to showcase what I have done already and, to showcase future projects also. 
Mainly screenshots and repositories of sites that I have built for clients. 
In the future it will have mini Javascript projects that I have made and a contact page for people to reach me. 

I will be using HTML 5, CSS3 And JavaScript
